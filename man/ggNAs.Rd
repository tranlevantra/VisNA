\title{Visualize Missing Data Summary}
\usage{
ggNAs(data, response = NULL, ncol = 2)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A data frame containing the variables to be analyzed for missing values.}

\item{response}{Optional. A character vector specifying one or more response variables for
grouping. If `NULL`, the plot shows overall missing data counts without grouping.}

\item{ncol}{Integer. The number of columns to use in the facetted plot layout.
Defaults to `2`.}
}
\value{
A ggplot object showing a bar plot of missing data counts for each variable, either
overall or grouped by response levels. If a response variable is specified, missing values
for each response level are displayed in separate facets.
}
\description{
`ggNAs` generates a summary plot of missing data for each variable in a dataset. Users can
visualize overall missing values or, if a response variable is specified, missing values by
groups within the response variable.
}
\details{
- **No Response Specified**: When `response = NULL`, the plot shows the total count of
missing and non-missing values for each variable.
- **With Response**: When a response variable is provided, the plot shows the count of
missing values grouped by levels of the response variable, with facets for each group.

\examples{
# Example usage with dummy data
data <- data.frame(
  var1 = c(1, 2, NA, 4, NA),
  var2 = c(NA, 2, NA, 4, 5),
  var3 = c(1, NA, 3, 4, 5),
  response = factor(c("A", "B", "A", "A", "B"))
)

# Overall missing data summary
ggNAs(data)

# Missing data summary by response variable, customized with 3 facets on each row
ggNAs(data, response = "response", ncol = 3)

}
