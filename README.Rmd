**VisNA** is an R package for visualizing and analyzing missing data patterns, helping users identify missing data mechanisms to improve data analysis and modeling.

There are three types of missing data mechanisms (Rubin, 1976):

- Missing Completely at Random (MCAR): Missingness is unrelated to any data (observed or unobserved). Formal tests, such as Little's MCAR test, and visualization tools, like mosaic plots, are often used to detect MCAR (Templ, 2022).

- Missing at Random (MAR): The probability of missingness is related to observed data but not to the missing values themselves.

- Missing Not at Random (MNAR): Missingness depends on the unobserved data, meaning that the missing values themselves influence whether they are missing.

In practice, MCAR is rare, with most missing data mechanisms falling under MAR or MNAR. **VisNA** is particularly helpful in visualizing missing patterns and assisting in identifying these two common mechanisms, making it a valuable tool in the preprocessing and analysis of incomplete datasets.



## Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
if (!require("devtools")) install.packages("devtools")

#Install
devtools::install_github("tranlevantra/VisNA")

#Load
library(VisNA)
```

## Usage

Usage to be found in below vignettes for this package two main functions:

- [ggNAs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VisNA/vignettes/Introduction_to_VisNA.html)

- [ggpairsNAs](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/VisNA/vignettes/Missing_Data_Mechanisms.html)


This package supports with missing data patterns summary and aids in missing data mechanisms identification.
